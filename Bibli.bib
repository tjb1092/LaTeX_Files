The model was then utilized to show the application of these devices in speech recognition.

journal={Journal of Neuroscience},
volume={2},
number={1},
pages={32-48},
abstract={The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further.},

abstract={In this paper we present a very exciting overlap between emergent nanotechnology and neuroscience, which has been discovered by neuromorphic engineers. Specifically, we are linking one type of memristor nanotechnology devices to the biological synaptic update rule known as spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) found in real biological synapses. Understanding this link allows neuromorphic engineers to develop circuit architectures that use this type of memristors to artificially emulate parts of the visual cortex. We focus on the type of memristors referred to as voltage or flux driven memristors and focus our discussions on a behavioral macro-model for such devices. The implementations result in fully asynchronous architectures with neurons sending their action potentials not only forward but also backward. One critical aspect is to use neurons that generate spikes of specific shapes. We will see how by changing the shapes of the neuron action potential spikes we can tune and manipulate the STDP learning rules for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We will see how neurons and memristors can be interconnected to achieve large scale spiking learning systems, that follow a type of multiplicative STDP learning rule. We will briefly extend the architectures to use three-terminal transistors with similar memristive behavior. We will illustrate how a V1 visual cortex layer can assembled and how it is capable of learning to extract orientations from visual data coming from a real artificial CMOS spiking retina observing real life scenes. Finally, we will discuss limitations of currently available memristors. The results presented are based on behavioral simulations and do not take into account non-idealities of devices and interconnects. The aim of this paper is to present, in a tutorial manner, an initial framework for the possible development of fully asynchronous STDP learning neuromorphic architectures exploiting two or three-terminal memristive type devices.

All files used for the simulations are made available through the journal web site.;In this paper we present a very exciting overlap between emergent nanotechnology and neuroscience, which has been discovered by neuromorphic engineers. Specifically, we are linking one type of memristor nanotechnology devices to the biological synaptic update rule known as spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) found in real biological synapses. Understanding this link allows neuromorphic engineers to develop circuit architectures that use this type of memristors to artificially emulate parts of the visual cortex. We focus on the type of memristors referred to as voltage or flux driven memristors and focus our discussions on a behavioral macro-model for such devices. The implementations result in fully asynchronous architectures with neurons sending their action potentials not only forward but also backward. One critical aspect is to use neurons that generate spikes of specific shapes. We will see how by changing the shapes of the neuron action potential spikes we can tune and manipulate the STDP learning rules for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We will see how neurons and memristors can be interconnected to achieve large scale spiking learning systems, that follow a type of multiplicative STDP learning rule.

abstract={In this paper we review several ways of realizing asynchronous Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) using memristors as synapses. Our focus is on how to use individual memristors to implement synaptic weight multiplications, in a way such that it is not necessary to (a) introduce global synchronization and (b) to separate memristor learning phases from memristor performing phases. In the approaches described, neurons fire spikes asynchronously when they wish and memristive synapses perform computation and learn at their own pace, as it happens in biological neural systems. We distinguish between two different memristor physics, depending on whether they respond to the original ``moving wall'' or to the ``filament creation and annihilation'' models. Independent of the memristor physics, we discuss two different types of STDP rules that can be implemented with memristors: either the pure timing-based rule that takes into account the arrival time of the spikes from the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons, or a hybrid rule that takes into account only the timing of pre-synaptic spikes and the membrane potential and other state variables of the post-synaptic neuron. We show how to implement these rules in cross-bar architectures that comprise massive arrays of memristors, and we discuss applications for artificial vision.;In this paper we review several ways of realizing asynchronous Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) using memristors as synapses.

abstract={How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central question in neuroscience research. Key to today’s research into information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Donald Hebb’s 1949 postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and persistently coactive cells should increase connective strength among populations of interconnected neurons as a means of storing a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly was not the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history. Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were directly inspired by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent years, a novel concept in cellular learning has emerged, where temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. This new learning paradigm — known as Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity, or STDP — has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because of its combination of elegant simplicity, biological plausibility, and computational power. But what are the roots of today’s STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle, Locke and Ribot, traversing e.g. Lugaro’s plasticità and Rosenblatt’s Perceptron, and culminating with the discovery of STDP. We highlight interactions between theoretical and experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field, and sometimes via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point out where the future directions may lie, which includes interneuron STDP, the functional impact of STDP, its mechanisms and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP to the developmental formation and continuous plasticity of neuronal networks.;How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central question in neuroscience.

abstract={We tested a theoretical prediction that patterns of excitatory input activity that consistently fail to activate target neurons sufficiently to induce synaptic potentiation will instead cause a specific synaptic depression. To realize this situation experimentally, the Schaffer collateral projection to area CA1 in rat hippocampal slices was stimulated electrically at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 50 Hz. Nine hundred pulses at 1-3 Hz consistently yielded a depression of the CA1 population excitatory postsynaptic potential that persisted without signs of recovery for greater than 1 hr after cessation of the conditioning stimulation. This long-term depression was specific to the conditioned input, ruling out generalized changes in postsynaptic responsiveness or excitability. Three lines of evidence suggest that this effect is accounted for by a modification of synaptic effectiveness rather than damage to or fatigue of the stimulated inputs. First, the effect was dependent on the stimulation frequency; 900 pulses at 10 Hz caused no lasting change, and at 50 Hz a synaptic potentiation was usually observed. Second, the depressed synapses continued to support long-term potentiation in response to a high-frequency tetanus. Third, the effects of conditioning stimulation could be prevented by application of NMDA receptor antagonists. Thus, our data suggest that synaptic depression can be triggered by prolonged NMDA receptor activation that is below the threshold for inducing synaptic potentiation.

abstract={It is shown that for many problems, particularly those in which the input data are ill-conditioned and the computation can be specified in a relative manner, biological solutions are many orders of magnitude more effective than those using digital methods. This advantage can be attributed principally to the use of elementary physical phenomena as computational primitives, and to the representation of information by the relative values of analog signals rather than by the absolute values of digital signals. This approach requires adaptive techniques to mitigate the effects of component differences. This kind of adaptation leads naturally to systems that learn about their environment. Large-scale adaptive analog systems are more robust to component degradation and failure than are more conventional systems, and they use far less power. For this reason, adaptive analog technology can be expected to utilize the full potential of wafer-scale silicon fabrication.< >;Biological information-processing systems operate on completely different principles from those with which most engineers are familiar.

Although various materials have been reported, it is difficult to meet device criteria such as high speed operation, low power switching, switching uniformity, endurance, long-term retention and selection device for cross-point array. We have investigated various ReRAM devices to meet the nonvolatile memory requirements. We developed wafer scale PCMO-ReRAM devices which exhibit excellent switching uniformity and analog memory behavior.

abstract={Chemical synapses are important components of the large-scaled neural network in the hippocampus of the mammalian brain, and a change in their weight is thought to be in charge of learning and memory. Thus, the realization of artificial chemical synapses is of crucial importance in achieving artificial neural networks emulating the brain's functionalities to some extent. This kind of research is often referred to as neuromorphic engineering. In this study, we report short-term memory behaviours of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) utilizing TiO2 mixed ionic-electronic conductor and various reactive electrode materials e.g. Ti, Ni, and Cr. By experiments, it turned out that the potentiation behaviours did not represent unlimited growth of synaptic weight. Instead, the behaviours exhibited limited synaptic weight growth that can be understood by means of an empirical equation similar to the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, employing a sliding threshold. The observed potentiation behaviours were analysed using the empirical equation and the differences between the different ECs were parameterized.;Chemical synapses are important components of the large-scaled neural network in the hippocampus of the mammalian brain, and a change in their weight is thought to be in charge of learning and memory.

At 600°C, the scale remained protective while the integrity of W O layer was kept. Rapid increase in mass gain resulted from massive cracking at local areas in the W O layer. Then, a coarse non-protective columnar WO scale was developed which favoured rapid inward oxygen transport into the alloy. At 700 and 800°C, growth stresses in the scale were released through local cracking. At this stage, WO became progressively transformed into WO when the oxygen partial pressure increased across the scale thickness. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;},

abstract={In this paper, we propose two emulator circuits. Firstly, we present a novel memristor emulator based on operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) which is different from classical TiO sub(2) memristor. This memristor emulator has a threshold switching mechanism. Secondly, we create a novel neuron circuit using proposed memristor, which is capable of generating spiking and bursting firing behaviors, with a biologically plausible spike shapes. The behavior of this neuron circuit can be adjusted by changing only one external biasing voltage. This neuron circuit mimics the behavior of cortical neurons, such as regular spiking (RS), intrinsic bursting (IB), chattering (CH) and fast spiking (FS). Proposed emulator circuits are compatible with VLSI systems and they can also be implemented by using discrete circuit components for different applications.},

It describes strong PUF implementations and their use for low-cost authentication. After this description, the paper covers both attacks and protocols to address errors. Next, the paper covers weak PUF implementations and their use in key generation applications. It covers error-correction schemes such as pattern matching and index-based coding.

pages={138-140},
abstract={The stochastic switching mechanism and intrinsic variability of resistive random access memory (RRAM) present severe challenges for memory applications, which, however, may be utilized to implement the physical unclonable function (PUF) for hardware security. A PUF based on RRAM resistance variability is proposed in this letter. Unlike PUFs based on manufacturing variation, this proposal exploits an intrinsic variability in physical mechanisms with reconfigurability. Key characteristics of the PUF design are assessed by simulation using measured RRAM properties and device model. Truly random variation of RRAM resistance is critical for PUF uniqueness (or unclonability). The reliability (or robustness) of the proposed PUF is affected by temperature and voltage dependence of RRAM resistance as well as retention characteristics. Large separation between inter-chip and intra-chip Hamming distance as the measure of uniqueness and reliability confirms the feasibility of the PUF proposal.},

abstract={Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are increasingly used for authentication and identification applications as well as the cryptographic key generation. An important feature of a PUF is the reliance on minute random variations in the fabricated hardware to derive a trusted random key. Currently, most PUF designs focus on exploiting process variations intrinsic to the CMOS technology. In recent years, progress in emerging nanoelectronic devices has demonstrated an increase in variation as a consequence of scaling down to the nanoregion. To date, emerging PUFs with nanotechnology have not been fully established, but they are expected to emerge. Initial research in this area aims to provide security primitives for emerging integrated circuits with nanotechnology. In this paper, we review emerging nanotechnology-based PUFs.},

abstract={Identification, authentication, and integrity checking are important tasks for ensuring the security and protection of valuable objects, devices, programs, and data. The utilization of the microscopic, random, and unclonable disorder of physical media for such security tasks has recently gained increasing attention. Wherever applicable, the harnessing of disorder can lead to intriguing advantages: First, it can avoid the permanent storage of digital secret keys in vulnerable hardware, promising to make the resulting systems more resilient against invasive and malware attacks. Second, random physical disorder has the natural feature of being very hard to clone and to forge: Fully controlling the micro- and nanoscale fabrication variations in physical media is extremely difficult and, even if possible, prohibitively expensive. Third, utilization of the natural disorder and entropy in physical systems can sometimes enable cryptographic protocols whose security does not rest on the usual unproven number-theoretic assumptions like factoring and discrete log, creating an alternate foundation for cryptography. Physical Unclonable Functions or PUFs are perhaps the best known representative of this new class of “disordered” cryptoprimitives, but there are also others. In this chapter, we provide a classification for past and ongoing work in physical disorder based security alongside with security analyses and implementation examples. We will also outline some open problems and future research opportunities in the area.},
